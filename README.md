List of Ideas
Below are the ideas for resolving time management problems:
A task scheduler with deadlines and priority levels.
A calendar integration to align tasks with other commitments.
A timer for focused work sessions without distractions.
A habit tracker to monitor daily habits.
Customizable reminders and notifications for pending tasks.
A daily dashboard with key metrics and tasks scheduled.
Time tracking analytics to provide insights on productivity.
Collaborative tools to allow users to share tasks with family or teams.
Dark theme and accessibility options for a user-friendly experience.

Proposed Solution
We will combine a task scheduler, calendar integration, timer, and custom reminders to create a user-friendly and effective time management experience.
Why this combination?
The task scheduler allows users to plan their daily, weekly, and monthly goals efficiently.
Calendar integration stops users from double-booking commitments and enables them to visualize their workload.
The timer maintains user focus and productivity with structured work sessions.
Reminders, which are configurable, keep users on task without overwhelming them with notifications.
Features to Implement
User Dashboard: Homepage summary of daily tasks, reminders, and progress.
Task Scheduling System: Create, edit, and remove tasks with deadlines.
Integrated Calendar: Combine tasks with an integrated calendar view.
Timer: Configurable work sessions with breaks.
Reminders & Notifications: Customized notifications for tasks and breaks.
Time Analytics: Report page showing time spent.
Dark Mode & Accessibility Settings: For better usability.
Collaboration Features: Users can share tasks with others.
Data Export Options: Allow users to download schedules.
